# AWS Big Data certification

One of the most popular use cases of cloud services is Big Data. Amazon Web Services provides lots of tools to act as a solution to problems related to computing and storing Big Data. Individuals and Big Data experts can get themselves certified in Big Data technologies using the AWS platform through [AWS Big Data certification](https://intellipaat.com/aws-big-data-certification-training/), which is accepted industry-wide. Today, we are covering all the information on this certification exam and how to qualify the same
As server technologies become more affordable, big tech giants are investing a great deal in cloud services. Hardware costs have become incredibly cheaper over the years when compared to the early 2000s. As a result, the subscription cost of cloud services has also gone drastically down, making them an immensely viable option for medium-to-low tier companies. Of course, despite the best Internet connectivity, nothing can beat the latency advantages of locally-housed servers, but these modern cloud enterprises, such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, are providing their customers with fully managed, highly scalable and secure, computational and storage resources, with pay-as-you-go pricing models.

A lot of times, dedicating an entire admin team and office space to maintaining a server may prove to be more expensive than renting it out using a cloud service. Organizations that do not require the availability of Big Data clusters and server resources around the clock may also opt for these online solutions. Hence, it is extremely relevant for people aspiring to get ahead in the fields of Big Data and Data Science to get accustomed to cloud platforms.

The skills required to work on data using cloud platforms are highly sought after today. Here, the AWS Certified Big Data – Specialty accolade proves that a candidate is not only proficient in operating individual Big Data services on AWS but is also capable of easily integrating and running multiple Big Data services in conjunction.

## Introduction to Big Data
Data comes in various shapes and forms. In technical terms, every fundamental unit of information stored on a computer system is called data. This data is categorized into three types. The types are mentioned and explained as follows:

Structured data: It is the data that is present in the form of properly structured, SQL-like tables, with well-defined columns and rows. This data is the most organized category of data that exists and can easily be queried or converted into Data Analytics and Data Science models. For example, tables created within databases in MySQL can be termed as structured data.
Semi-structured data: As the name suggests, semi-structured datasets have somewhat a structure but are present in the form of files, unlike SQL tables. In most cases, these datasets can be converted into structured datasets by running them through a conversion algorithm. For example, CSV (comma separated) and JSON files are semi-structured because they have a fixed syntax associated with their contents and can be converted into SQL tables pretty easily.
Unstructured data: Unstructured data is present in a file format and is completely random in appearance. These datasets do not have any fixed structure or syntax associated with them, and it is up to the data expert to derive any meaning out of them. For example, media files such as JPEG, MP3, MP4, etc. are usually random in their content when converted to a text file.
When we take a step further and immensely increase the scale of this data, we get Big Data. However, the criteria aren’t that simple, and for data to be accurately termed as Big Data, there are five conditions that need to be met, called the 5 Vs of Big Data:

## AWS Big Data Certification Tips
The AWS Big Data certification difficulty is moderate to high, so do not take it lightly. Although all topics mentioned above should be thoroughly studied before attempting the AWS Certified Big Data Specialty examination, there are some key subjects that you can focus on:

Amazon Kinesis
Amazon DynamoDB
Amazon EMR
Amazon Redshift
AWS Lambda
Going through the entire syllabus with a special emphasis on the above topics is certain to give you the edge required to qualify for the AWS Big Data Certification exam in the first attempt.

## AWS Big Data Certification Preparation
There are various ways you can go about preparing for the AWS Big Data certification exam. But at a hefty exam fee of US$300, it is in your best interest to make your first attempt successful. So, how should you go about this?

Your first option would be to search for study material and videos for each of the topics online, which could be completely disorganized without any proper course curriculum or structure. Often, this methodology jumbles up certain concepts and can prove to be extremely inefficient with regards to time. Another issue with such learning is when the technology gets upgraded. Then, the course material and syllabus may get tremendously confusing. Moreover, in the case of AWS Certified Big Data Speciality, there isn’t a lot of comprehensive material available online as well.

The alternative to completely relying on self-study would be to opt for a well-organized course on the subject matter. At Intellipaat, we have realized the lack of study material online, alongside the absence of hands-on exercises, and have come up with the AWS Big Data Training. The program covers the entire exam syllabus in detail with qualified instructors taking live classes, alongside comprehensive self-paced videos demonstrating various topics through diagrammatic and hands-on content.
